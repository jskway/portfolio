      <P>
        3 years ago, I came across a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website tutorial.
        Instantly, I became fascinated with coding and the ability to build
        interactive apps. In September 2020, I graduated from Lambda School's
        part-time (18mo) Full Stack Web & Computer Science program.

      <P>
        I love perfecting the details of my craft and apply creativity and
        rationality to everything I do. I believe the most challenging goals can
        be accomplished with enough insight, understanding, and desire.
      </P>

      <P>
        I'm aiming to contribute scalable, robust, and maintainable code to a
        company & team that provides users with an amazing experience.

        In my free time, I enjoy writing, boxing, and listening to synthwave{" "}
