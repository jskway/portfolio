Node.js and Express were the focus of my studies over the past two weeks.

The Lambda School curriculum covered:
- The main features of Node.js and Express
- How to use Postman to manually test web APIs
- How to create a CRUD web API
- Using Express routers to organize our code
- What middleware is and how to implement them
- Setting up .env files and deploying to Heroku

<br />

### Node and Express

**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime (program that runs other programs) built on
Chrome's V8 engine.  It allows us to run JavaScript outside the browser.  The
most common use cases are utilities and server code.

**Express** is a web framework for Node.js.  It sits on top of Node's native 'http'
module.  It provides extra functionality like routing and middleware support -
with a simpler API.  We can think of it like React for the backend.

**Middleware:** functions that receive the request and response objects.  The
middleware function can operate on them (optional) and return a response or
call the next middleware in the pipeline. 

Express's middleware stack is made up of an array of functions.

**Routing**: The process of determining which request handler function is
executed based on the URL visited and the HTTP method used.  

A **resource** is the target of an HTTP request, identified by a URI.  It can be
a document, a photo, JSON object, or anything else.

### HTTP Status Codes

From Wikipedia: *Status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's
request made to the server.  All HTTP status codes are separated into five
categories:*

- 1xx Informational – the request was received, continuing process
- 2xx Successful – the request was successfully received, understood and accepted
- 3xx Redirection – further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
- 4xx Client Error – the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
- 5xx Server Error – the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request

**Simple example of a Express server:**

```javascript
const express = require('express');

const server = express();

server.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World');
});

server.get('/hobbits', (req, res) => {
  const hobbits = [
    {
      id: 1,
      name: 'Samwise Gamgee',
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      name: 'Frodo Baggins',
    },
  ];

  res.status(200).json(hobbits);
});

server.listen(8000, () => console.log('API running on port 8000'));
```

**API** stands for Application Programming Interface.  Essentially a communication
protocol that specifies how clients and servers should interact. We can think of
an API as a waiter in a restaurant.  We (the client) enter the restaurant and view
the menu, then give the waiter our order.  The waiter brings our request to the
kitchen (server) and then brings back to us what we ordered.

### Express Routers & Middleware

We can use Express Routers to split an application into sub-applications to make
it more modular and easier to maintain.

Middleware is the biggest part of Express.  Most of the code we write, including
route handlers, is middleware under the hood.

We can think of middleware as an array of functions that get called in the order
they are introduced in the server code.

There are different types of middleware.

**Built-in middleware** is included with Express, but not added to the
application automatically.  I.e. `server.use(express.json());`

**Third party middleware** are npm modules that we install and import into our
apps using `require()`. Eg. [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) (for logging) and [helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) (for security).

**Custom middleware** are functions that we write to perform certain tasks.  

Example of custom error handler middleware:
```javascript
server.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err);

  res
    .status(500)
    .json({ message: 'There was an error performing the required operation' });
});
// We want to have error handlers at the end of our file so it's the last
// function in our middleware stack.  If no response is returned from any of the
// functions and next() is called, then this error handler will run 
```

<br />

### Deployment & Best Practices

Most development pipelines have different environments that often include:
development, testing, and production.  It's good practice to extract away any
values that need to change between environments, like database connections.

We can do this by adding a `.env` file to the root folder that stores these
values.  And then using the `dotenv` module along with Node's `process.env`
object in our index.js file.

Example: 
```javascript
// it's recommended to load configuration for .env as early as possible
require('dotenv').config(); // add this line as the first thing to run1

const server = require('./api/server.js');

// we'll read the port from the server environment if it is there
// heroku will have the PORT environment variable set
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;

// we can now use that port, if set up by heroku or read from .env or 5000 as a default if not set
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`\n*** Server Running on http://localhost:${port} ***\n`);
});
```

Overall, the last two weeks were a welcome interlude from working on front-end
and React code.  Node.js and especially Express was enjoyable to work with.
It's cool to get a understanding of how the APIs I've been making requests
to are built and organized.  I'm excited to dive into SQL and authentication 
and then combine all of my experience to built an actual full stack application.
