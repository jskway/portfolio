Spent a couple of hours today reviewing basic JS concepts via Gordon Zhu's Practical Javascript Course.

The most valuable lesson of the day actually had little to do with JavaScript or coding itself.

It was actually the concept of:

**Ability = Process * Time**

There's no benefit to focusing on things you can't control. Such as other peoples' skill level or the number of years of experience you lack.

So focus on what you can control: *Your Process.*

Focusing on a good process also makes you much faster and efficient with your time. Surprisingly, the most important part of your process (according to Gordon) is _how you ask questions_. Reading through [this article](https://medium.com/@gordon_zhu/how-to-be-great-at-asking-questions-e37be04d0603) he wrote will clarify.

As for my JavaScript notes:

<u>On scope</u>  

If you're inside of a function, you can look outside and access data, but the opposite isn't true. If you're outside, you can't look in.

<u>On objects</u>  

In general, you use objects in JS to group together related data and functions.  
- Each piece of data in an object is called a **property**  
- Each function in an object is called a **method**

`this` when used in a method, will refer to the object itself (more on that in later modules).

Console tip: You can comment out multiple highlighted lines with âŒ˜ (Command) + /

The `!` operator returns the opposite of whatever comes after it. 

For example:
```javascript
!true == false , !false == true 
```
