Just completed my Lambda School [sprint challenge](https://github.com/jskway/Sprint-Challenge--JavaScript), which brings closure to the Applied Javascript module!

I learned a lot over the past two weeks. The curriculum covered:  
- The DOM and different DOM selectors  
- Using different properties and methods to to manipulate selected elements  
- How to create new elements, manipulate them and add them to the DOM  
- Browser events, and adding event listeners and event handlers  
- Recognizing event propagation and when/how to prevent it  
- Components and identifying different parts of a component  
- Creating custom data attributes with HTML and using them in CSS and JS  
- How to utilize multiple classes to build components

<u>**Some notes:**</u>

The biggest difference between `.forEach` and `.map` is that `.map` returns a newly created array while `.forEach` doesn't return anything (both iterate through array values)

Closure is when a function is able to remember and access its lexical scope, even when executing outside of its lexical scope.

`this` keyword rules:  
- Object/Global: When in global scope, `this` is the window object  
- Implicit: When called in a method, `this` is the object to the immediate left of the . (dot)  
- Explicit: When a function is called with `.call`, `.apply` or .`bind`, `this` is the object that's passed in as the first argument  
- New: When called in a constructor function, `this` is the newly created object

We use `super()` in a class to call the parent's constructor function while abstracting away manually linking the parent's prototype to the child's prototype

The **DOM**, or **Document Object Model**, is the browser's representation of our HTML document. The structure is a tree of nodes we can interact with to manipulate the page.

An **event** is an action that takes place in the DOM. It could be triggered by user interactions (eg. clicks, scrolls) or generated by APIs.

An **event listener** is attached to a DOM element and listens for a specific event to occur, and then passes that event into the provided callback function.

A **component** is a reusable piece of code that can be used to build elements that share functionality and styling.

Next up is Build Week  I'm looking forward to working on a project with other students!
