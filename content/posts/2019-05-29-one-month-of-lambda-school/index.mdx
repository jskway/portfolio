This week marks my sixth week of attending Lambda School's part-time Full Stack Web Development program.

So far, we've covered:  
- Basic HTML5/CSS  
- Git and basic CLI commands  
- Responsive Design and Preprocessors (LESS)  
- Basic JS (var/let/const, closure, callbacks, .map, .reduce, .filter)

In the Advanced CSS lectures/projects, I learned new responsive design and preprocessor best practices.

The Git section was straightforward - I'm now very comfortable checking out to new branches, committing & pushing changes, and making pull requests.

The JavaScript section was the most comfortable section so far (the majority of my self-study time was devoted to JS) but I'm excited to push through it and get to the React section. I've heard a lot about React and its popularity. I'm looking forward to understanding what all the hype is about.

This week we're covering the `this` keyword, constructor functions, the JS Prototype Object, and the `class` keyword.

The instructors have been great so far and very thorough with answering questions.

Also got moved to a new PM group. My new PM and group members are friendly and motivated to share and review our code during our bi-weekly stand ups.

Overall its been a great experience and I'm looking forward to the React modules!
