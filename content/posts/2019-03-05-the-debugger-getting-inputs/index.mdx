Today's Practical JavaScript lessons covered the Chrome debugger and getting user input data.

**Notes:**

Debugging is the process of going through your code and fixing mistakes.

The `debugger;` statement pauses your program at that point in your code.

&#8216;Step over next function call&#8217; skips to the next line.

&#8216;Step into function call&#8217; goes into the code block of the highlighted function.

*The debugger is the most important weapon you have when programming.* It helps you solve problems if you have a bug in your code and gives you full visibility into what the program is doing.

**Refactoring** is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior.

When getting user input as a number, use `.valueAsNumber` rather than `.value`

74% done with Practical Javascript now. I really liked the debugger section &#8211; something I overlooked and didn&#8217;t use much in the past.
